This API has two different endpoints:
1. An endpoint which returns the game data of a particular game id
2. An endpoint that returns game metadatas of all games which fit search criteria


REQUEST: /game/<game_id>
    Returns the game data of the given game_id

RESPONSE: A JSON dictionary of the game data. The dictionary fields are:

    white_username -- (TEXT)
    white_rating ---- (INTEGER)
    black_username -- (TEXT)
    black_rating ---- (INTEGER)
    turns ----------- (INTEGER) the number of moves in the game
    victory_status -- (TEXT) such as draw, outoftime, mate

                        slashes which indicate the end of the row. See below for a table of which
                        characters correspond to which pieces.
    captured_pieces - (LIST OF TEXT) the piece captured, if there was one, after each turn. Each element in

REQUEST: /games[<search_criteria>]
    Request a list of all games which match a certain search criteria. The search criteria is specified by GET parameters.

GET Parameters:
    user ----------- (optional, default:"") Only include games where this user played. The value is case-insensitive,
                        and will also match any usernames which start with the given value.
                        Ex: /gameslist?user=avocado
    turns ---------- (optional, default: infinity, default comparitor: =) returns games played with a certain number of turns
                    can be modified with + or - to obtain a list of games with turns above (+) or below (-) the specified number
                    Ex: /gameslist?turns+15 *games with more than 15 turns*
    rating_max ----- (optional, default: infinity) Only include games where both players are rated below this number
                        Ex: /gameslist?rating_max=1600

    page_id -------- (optional, default: 0) Limit the data returned to a certain number of entries. 
    page_size ------ (optional, default: 10) The number of entries per page.
                        NOTE: If either page_id or page_size is specified as non-negative integers, the API will
                        paginate the data. Otherwise, it will return all the data.


RESPONSE: A JSON list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains data about a particular game. This JSON
    list will be sorted in descending order of player ranking. By the "player ranking" of a game, we mean the
    rating of the higher-ranked player. The fields of each game dictionary are:

    game_id --------- (TEXT) this id can be used to request the full game data (see /game/<game_id> endpoint)
    white_username -- (TEXT)
    white_rating ---- (INTEGER)
    black_username -- (TEXT)
    black_rating ---- (INTEGER)
    turns ----------- (INTEGER) the number of moves in the game
    victory_status -- (TEXT) such as draw, outoftime, mate
    winner ---------- (TEXT) one of three values: "black", "white", or "draw"

    Notice that these fields do include data about the content of the game. Use /game/<game_id> for full game data.
